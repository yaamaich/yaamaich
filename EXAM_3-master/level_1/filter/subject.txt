Assignement name : filter

Expected files : filter.c

Allowed functions : printf, perror, calloc, malloc, realloc, strlen,
					read, free
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that will take one argument s.

Your program will then read from stdin and write all the content read in
stdout except that every occurence of s must be replaced by '*' (as many
as the length of s).

For example :

./filter bonjour
will behave the same way as :
sed 's/bonjour/*******/g'

./filter abc
will behave the same way as :
sed 's/abc/***/g'

more generally your program must be the equivalent of the shell script
filter.sh present in this directory (you can compare your program with
it)

In case of error during read or a malloc you must write "Error: "
followed by the error message in stderr and return 1.

For example this should work :
$> echo 'abcdefaaaabcdeabcabcdabc' | ./filter abc | cat -e
***defaaa***de******d***$

$> echo 'ababcabababc' | ./a.out ababc | cat -e
*****ab*****$
